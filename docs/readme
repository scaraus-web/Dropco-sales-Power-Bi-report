A compact Power BI report showcasing **Dropco** sales performance using a **public-safe dataset** (no per-SKU cost, inventory depth, replenishment, PII, or campaign IDs). Built to demonstrate modeling, DAX, and dashboarding while protecting business data.

## Data (public-safe)

**File:** `Dropco stock movements w sales campains public .csv`
**Grain:** Monthly, Category/SKU level suitable for public sharing.

**Columns (pattern)**

* `SKU` *(or alias)*
* `Name`
* `Categories`
* **Monthly columns** named as `YYYY-MM` (e.g., `2023-10`, `2023-11`, …) holding the monthly sales/units used in visuals.

**Intentionally excluded**

* Per-SKU **cost/COGS**, **inventory levels**, **replenishment columns**, **campaign identifiers**, and **granular ad metrics**.

**Safeguards**

* Aggregated by month/category (no transaction/PII).
* Values may be rounded and small counts suppressed in visuals/measures for public sharing.
* Recent weeks/months can be omitted in public views.

> **Interpretation:** Trends and proportions reflect reality; fine-grained operational details are intentionally masked.

## Measures (conceptual)

* **Total Sales** — sum of monthly sales values from the public CSV.
* **Total Cost** — sanitized aggregate used only for high-level margin storytelling.
* **Total Profit** — *Sales − Cost*.
* **Profit Margin %** — *Profit ÷ Sales*.
* **Target Sales** — fixed/dynamic goal used in the KPI card.

*(Exact measure names in the PBIX may differ; this is the conceptual layer used by the visuals.)*
